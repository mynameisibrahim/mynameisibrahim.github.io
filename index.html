    <h1>Definition of Quality Education</h1>
    <img src="WebImages/index12.jpg" alt="" width="271" height="186" class="my_image"/><p>"A good quality education is one that provides all learners with capabilities they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being. The learning outcomes that are required vary according to context but at the end of the basic education cycle must include levels of literacy and numeracy, basic scientific knowledge and life skills including awareness and prevention of disease." </p>
    <h1>Six Crucial Dimensions of Quality Education </h1>
    <p>we believes that education leads to empowerment: a process of strengthening individuals, organisations and communities so they get more control over their own situations and environments. Quality education is a crucial factor in combating poverty and inequality in society. In quality education, VVOB distinguishes six dimensions that all interventions of the organisation need to meet.</p>
    <h1> Equity </h1>
    <img src="WebImages/good-quality-education-647x395.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/>
    <p>The VVOB definition refers to "all learners". This term refers to non-discrimination and equity. Equity in education means that personal and social circumstances such as gender, ethnic origin or family background are not obstacles to achieving educational potential and that all individuals reach at least a basic minimum level of skills. VVOB in particular focuses on gender equity.</p>
    <h1> Contextualisation and Relevance </h1>
    <img src="WebImages/index1.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/>
    <p>Quality education cannot be based on a blueprint that is applicable in all situations. Solutions and adaptations of education systems must be based on the real needs of a country and/or community. To guarantee this, we evaluates its interventions.</p>
    <h1> Child-friendly Teaching and Learning</h1>
    <img src="WebImages/6 A blog.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/>
    <p> Quality education puts the child in the centre and helps it to reach his or her full potential. Quality Education requires children’s active participation.
      Sustainability
      Educational change processes often need time to be realised. By enhancing the capacities of local education authorities, VVOB aims to institutionalise these processes. </p>
    <h1>Balanced Approach</h1>
    <img src="WebImages/imagess.jpg" width="275" height="183" alt=""/>
    <p> Quality education aims at developing a balanced set of capabilities of children they require to become economically productive, develop sustainable livelihoods, contribute to peaceful and democratic societies and enhance individual well-being.</p>
    <h1> Learning Outcomes</h1>
    <img src="WebImages/talent.jpg" width="765" height="330" alt=""/>
    <p> After completing a certain level of education, children must have developed a minimum standard of skills. Quality education requires a results-oriented approach. </p>
    <h1>A Fundamental Principle</h1>
    <p> <strong><em>It is firmly believed that quality education can only be achieved if equity, and particularly gender equity, is achieved within the education system.</em></strong></p>

      Contemporary Issues and Trends in Education</h1>
    <p> Dr. Nilo Rosas Professor Prepared: Ms. Lhey E. Vinoya 
Learners who are healthy, well-nourished and ready to participate and learn, and supported in learning by their families and communities</p>
   <h1> Environments </h1>
   <p> Environment that are healthy, safe, protective and gender-sensitive, and provide adequate resources and facilities are great contributions. </p>
   <h1>Content </h1>
   <p>That is reflected in relevant curricula and materials for the acquisition of basic skills, esp. in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and skills for life, and knowledge in such areas as gender, health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS prevention and peace. </p>
   <h1> Processes</h1>
   <p> through which trained teachers use child-centered teaching approaches in well-managed classrooms and schools and skillful assessment to facilitate learning and reduce disparities.</p>
   <h1>  Outcomes </h1>
   <p>Outcomes that encompass knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and are linked to national goals for education and positive participation in society. Good health and nutrition  Healthy children learn well. Healthy development in early childhood, plays an important in providing the basis for a healthy life and a successful formal school experience. (McCain; Mustard, 1999)  Adequate nutrition is critical for normal brain development in the early years. Early Childhood psychosocial development experiences. Positive early experiences and interactions are also vital to preparing a quality learner. The benefits of good early childhood programs include better psychosocial development. Effective and program that sought to improve the literacy skills of low-income, undereducated mothers found that the mothers’ capacities to help develop their children’s language competencies increased, esp. in the areas of listening and speaking. </p>
   <h1> Physical Elements </h1>
   <p>Quality of School Facilities, Interaction between school infrastructure and other quality dimensions.  Class size: A study in INDIA sampled 59 schools and found that of these 49 had buildings, and of these, 25 had a toilet, 20 had electricity, 10 had a school library and 4 had a television (Carron; Chau, 1996). . Ability of the teachers to undertake certain instructional approaches. Many countries significantly expanded access to primary education during the 1990s, but the building of new schools has often not kept pace with the increase in the student population. Educators and researchers have debated the relationship between Class size and student learning at length. 
Psychosocial Elements   Peaceful, safe environments, esp. for girls Teachers’ behaviors that affect safety, effective school discipline policies inclusive environments Non-violence, Peaceful, safe environments, esp. for girls, research to better understand various communities’ needs and attitudes policy reforms , the building of latrines for girls in schools , institutional reform, and sensitization campaign to raise community awareness about the value of girls’ education.</p>
